# Zoo Feeder App

This web app uses the reusable `@zoo/animals` package for animal logic and feeding rules.

## Adding Animals

Animals from the `@zoo/animals` package are included automatically. You can also add custom animals to the web app by placing their modules in `src/animals/`. Any animal module in this folder (e.g., `src/animals/elephant.ts`) will be included in the app alongside the package animals.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```
